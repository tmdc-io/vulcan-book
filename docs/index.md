# Vulcan Book

Vulcan is a complete stack for building data products.

Tired of stitching together tools for testing, quality, semantics, and APIs? Ready to ship data products like software?

---

## What It Does

Vulcan gives you:

- **CI/CD for data** - Plan changes, test in virtual environments, deploy safely. See what breaks before you break it. Review impact, approve changes, roll back if needed. Just like software engineering, but for data.
- **Unit testing** - Test transformations locally without touching your warehouse. Fast feedback, no costs. Write tests that run in seconds, not hours. Catch bugs before they hit production.
- **Data quality** - Assertions that block bad data, checks that monitor quality. Quality as code, not an afterthought. Write validation rules alongside your models. Bad data gets stopped at the door.
- **Semantic layer** - Define metrics and dimensions. Vulcan generates schemas and APIs automatically. Business users get self-service analytics. Developers get automatic API generation. Everyone wins.
- **Automatic APIs** - REST, Python, and Graph APIs generated from your models. No manual API code needed. Query lineage with Cypher. Discover metrics programmatically. Access data however you need it.
- **Lifecycle management** - Dev, staging, prod environments with proper isolation. Ship with confidence. Test changes safely. Deploy when ready. No surprises.

## The Complete Stack

Everything you need to go from code to production-ready data products:

**Write** SQL or Python transformations. Use what you know. No new languages to learn.  
**Test** locally with unit tests and assertions. Fast feedback. No warehouse costs.  
**Validate** with built-in quality checks. Block bad data. Monitor quality over time.  
**Deploy** with CI/CD workflows and virtual environments. Review changes. Test safely. Ship with confidence.  
**Expose** via semantic layer and automatic APIs. Define metrics once. Generate APIs automatically.  
**Monitor** and iterate. Track changes. Understand impact. Fix issues quickly.

No tool sprawl. No manual stitching. Just write your transformations and let Vulcan handle the rest.

### How It Works Together

Vulcan isn't a collection of tools. It's a unified stack where everything works together:

1. **You write a transformation** - SQL or Python, your choice
2. **Vulcan validates it** - Syntax checks, type validation, dependency analysis
3. **You test it locally** - Unit tests run in seconds, no warehouse needed
4. **You add assertions** - Define what "good data" means, right in your model
5. **You plan the change** - See what will break, review impact, approve when ready
6. **Vulcan deploys it** - Virtual environments for testing, proper isolation for production
7. **Vulcan generates APIs** - REST, Python, and Graph APIs from your semantic layer
8. **You monitor and iterate** - Track changes, understand impact, fix issues quickly

Each step builds on the last. No manual handoffs. No context switching. Just a smooth workflow from code to production.

## Why Vulcan?

Most data teams spend more time on tooling than on building. You write SQL, then you write tests, then you write quality checks, then you write APIs, then you write documentation. It's exhausting.

Vulcan does all of that automatically. You write transformations. Vulcan handles testing, quality, semantics, and APIs. It's that simple.

### The Problem

Building data products shouldn't require a PhD in DevOps. But that's what it feels like:

- **No CI/CD** - Deploy changes blindly, hope nothing breaks, fix it in production
- **No testing** - Run transformations in production, wait hours for results, debug when things go wrong
- **No quality gates** - Bad data slips through, downstream systems break, trust erodes
- **No semantic layer** - Business users write SQL, metrics get redefined, nothing is consistent
- **No APIs** - Every consumer writes custom queries, performance suffers, maintenance nightmare

Sound familiar? You're not alone.

### The Solution

Vulcan fixes all of that. It's a complete stack that handles the entire data product lifecycle:

**Write** your transformations in SQL or Python. That's it. Vulcan takes care of the rest.

**Test** locally with unit tests. Get feedback in seconds. No warehouse costs. No waiting.

**Validate** with assertions and checks. Bad data gets blocked. Quality issues get caught early.

**Deploy** with CI/CD workflows. Review changes before deploying. Test in virtual environments. Roll back if needed.

**Expose** via semantic layer and APIs. Define metrics once. Vulcan generates everything else automatically.

**Monitor** and iterate. Track what changed. Understand impact. Fix issues quickly.

No tool sprawl. No manual stitching. No PhD required.

2. **[Models](models/index.md)** - Write SQL and Python transformations
3. **[Semantic Layer](semantic-layer/index.md)** - Define metrics and dimensions
4. **[Audits](audits/index.md)** - Block bad data with assertions
5. **[Quality Checks](quality-checks/index.md)** - Monitor data quality over time
6. **[APIs](apis/index.md)** - Access your data via REST, Python, and Graph APIs
7. **[Deployment](deployment/index.md)** - Deploy with CI/CD and manage environments

## How It's Different

Vulcan isn't just another data tool. It's a complete rethink of how data products should be built:

**CI/CD First** - Not an afterthought. Built into the workflow from day one. Plan, test, deploy, roll back. Just like software.

**Developer Experience First** - Fast feedback. Local testing. Great tooling. You shouldn't have to fight your tools.

**Quality Built-In** - Not a separate process. Write assertions alongside your models. Quality as code, not a checklist.

**Semantic Layer Native** - Not bolted on. Define metrics and dimensions. Get APIs automatically. No manual schema management.

**Automatic Everything** - APIs, schemas, documentation. You define the logic. Vulcan generates the rest.

**Complete Stack** - Not a collection of tools. Everything works together. No integration hell. No tool sprawl.

## Learning Path

Start with the basics, then build complexity:

```
Foundation (Chapters 1-2)
    ↓
Core Features (Chapters 3-6)
    ↓
Operations (Chapter 7)
```

Each chapter stands alone. Read what you need, when you need it.

**New to Vulcan?** Start with [Getting Started](getting-started/index.md). You'll be productive in 30 minutes.

**Building models?** Jump to [Models](models/index.md). Everything you need to write transformations.

**Defining metrics?** Check out [Semantic Layer](semantic-layer/index.md). Define business logic, get APIs automatically.

**Need quality?** Read [Audits](audits/index.md) and [Quality Checks](quality-checks/index.md). Block bad data, monitor quality.

**Deploying to production?** See [Deployment](deployment/index.md). CI/CD workflows, environment management, best practices.
