# Vulcan Book

Welcome to the **Vulcan Book** - comprehensive documentation for Vulcan, a SQLMesh wrapper with semantic layer and data validation capabilities.

## What is Vulcan?

Vulcan is a wrapper around SQLMesh that provides:

- **Semantic Layer**: Define business metrics and dimensions on top of physical models
- **Data Validation**: Built-in audits and quality checks for data reliability
- **Graph Database**: Query lineage and relationships using Cypher
