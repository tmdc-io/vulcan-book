# About

Vulcan is a complete stack for building data products.

Vulcan is a next-generation data transformation framework designed to ship data quickly, efficiently, and without error. Data teams can efficiently run and deploy data transformations written in SQL or Python with visibility and control at any size.

> Note: You may need to run `python3` or `pip3` instead of `python` or `pip`, depending on your python installation.

Follow the [quickstart guide](guides/get-started/docker.md) to learn how to use Vulcan. You already have a head start!
