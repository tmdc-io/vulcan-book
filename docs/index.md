# Vulcan Book

Vulcan is a complete stack for building data products.

Tired of stitching together tools for testing, quality, semantics, and APIs? Ready to ship data products like software?

## What It Does

Vulcan gives you:

- **CI/CD for data** - Plan changes, test in virtual environments, deploy safely. See what breaks before you break it.
- **Unit testing** - Test transformations locally without touching your warehouse. Fast feedback, no costs.
- **Data quality** - Assertions that block bad data, checks that monitor quality. Quality as code, not an afterthought.
- **Semantic layer** - Define metrics and dimensions. Vulcan generates schemas and APIs automatically.
- **Automatic APIs** - REST, Python, and Graph APIs generated from your models. No manual API code needed.
- **Lifecycle management** - Dev, staging, prod environments with proper isolation. Ship with confidence.

## The Complete Stack

Everything you need to go from code to production-ready data products:

**Write** SQL or Python transformations.  
**Test** locally with unit tests and assertions.  
**Validate** with built-in quality checks.  
**Deploy** with CI/CD workflows and virtual environments.  
**Expose** via semantic layer and automatic APIs.  
**Monitor** and iterate.

No tool sprawl. No manual stitching. Just write your transformations and let Vulcan handle the rest.

## Why Vulcan?

Most data teams spend more time on tooling than on building. You write SQL, then you write tests, then you write quality checks, then you write APIs, then you write documentation. It's exhausting.

Vulcan does all of that automatically. You write transformations. Vulcan handles testing, quality, semantics, and APIs. It's that simple.

## Quick Start

1. **[Getting Started](getting-started/index.md)** - Install and create your first project
2. **[Models](models/index.md)** - Write SQL and Python transformations
3. **[Semantic Layer](semantic-layer/index.md)** - Define metrics and dimensions
4. **[Audits](audits/index.md)** - Block bad data with assertions
5. **[Quality Checks](quality-checks/index.md)** - Monitor data quality over time
6. **[APIs](apis/index.md)** - Access your data via REST, Python, and Graph APIs
7. **[Deployment](deployment/index.md)** - Deploy with CI/CD and manage environments

## Learning Path

Start with the basics, then build complexity:

```
Foundation (Chapters 1-2)
    ↓
Core Features (Chapters 3-6)
    ↓
Operations (Chapter 7)
```

Each chapter stands alone. Read what you need, when you need it.
