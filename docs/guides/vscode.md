!!! danger "Preview"

    The Vulcan Visual Studio Code extension is in preview and undergoing active development. You may encounter bugs or API incompatibilities with the Vulcan version you are running.

    We encourage you to try the extension and [create Github issues](https://github.com/tobikodata/vulcan/issues) for any problems you encounter.

In this guide, you'll set up the Vulcan extension in the Visual Studio Code IDE software (which we refer to as "VSCode").

We'll show you the capabilities of the extension and how to troubleshoot common issues.

## Installation

### VSCode extension

Install the extension through the official Visual Studio [marketplace website](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tobikodata.vulcan) or by searching for `Vulcan` in the VSCode "Extensions" tab.

Learn more about installing VSCode extensions in the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/extensions/extension-marketplace#_install-an-extension).

### Python setup

While installing the extension is simple, setting up and configuring a Python environment in VSCode is a bit more involved.

We recommend using a dedicated *Python virtual environment* to install Vulcan. Visit the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for more information about virtual environments.

We describe the steps to create and activate a virtual environment below, but additional information is available on the [Vulcan installation page](../installation.md).

We first install the Vulcan library, which is required by the extension.

Open a terminal instance in your Vulcan project's directory and issue this command to create a virtual environment in the `.venv` directory:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Next, activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install Vulcan with the `lsp` extra that enables the VSCode extension (learn more about Vulcan extras [here](../installation.md#install-extras)):

```bash
pip install 'vulcan[lsp]'
```

### VSCode Python interpreter

A Python virtual environment contains its own copy of Python (the "Python interpreter").

We need to make sure VSCode is using your virtual environment's interpreter rather than a system-wide or other interpreter that does not have access to the Vulcan library we just installed.

Confirm that VSCode is using the correct interpreter by going to the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) and clicking `Python: Select Interpreter`. Select the Python executable that's in the virtual environment's directory `.venv`.

![Select interpreter](./vscode/select_interpreter.png)

Once that's done, validate that the everything is working correctly by checking the `vulcan` channel in the [output panel](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_output-panel). It displays the Python interpreter path and details of your Vulcan installation:

![Output panel](./vscode/interpreter_details.png)

## Features

Vulcan's VSCode extension makes it easy to edit and understand your Vulcan project with these features:

- Lineage
    - Interactive view of model lineage
- Editor
    - Auto-completion for model names and Vulcan keywords
    - Model summaries when hovering over model references
    - Links to open model files from model references
    - Inline Vulcan linter diagnostics
- VSCode commands
    - Format Vulcan project files
    - Sign in/out of Tobiko Cloud (Tobiko Cloud users only)

### Lineage

The extension adds a lineage view to Vulcan models. To view the lineage of a model, go to the `Lineage` tab in the panel:

![Lineage view](./vscode/lineage.png)

### Render

The extension allows you to render a model with the macros resolved. You can invoke it either with the command palette `Render Vulcan Model` or by clicking the preview button in the top right.

### Editor

The Vulcan VSCode extension includes several features that make editing Vulcan models easier and quicker:

**Completion**

See auto-completion suggestions when writing SQL models, keywords, or model names.

![Completion](./vscode/autocomplete.png)

**Go to definition and hover information**

Hovering over a model name shows a tooltip with the model description. 

In addition to hover information, you can go to a definition of the following objects in a SQL file by either right-clicking and choosing "Go to definition" or by `Command/Control + Click` on the respective reference. This currently works for:

- Model references in a SQL file like `FROM my_model`
- CTE reference in a SQL file like `WITH my_cte AS (...) ... FROM my_cte` 
- Python macros in a SQL file like `SELECT @my_macro(...)`

**Diagnostics**

If you have the [Vulcan linter](../guides/linter.md) enabled, issues are reported directly in your editor. This works for both Vulcan's built-in linter rules and custom linter rules.

![Diagnostics](./vscode/diagnostics.png)

**Formatting**

Vulcan's model formatting tool is integrated directly into the editor, so it's easy to format models consistently.

### Commands

The Vulcan VSCode extension provides the following commands in the VSCode command palette:

- `Format Vulcan project`
- `Sign in to Tobiko Cloud` (Tobiko Cloud users only)
- `Sign out of Tobiko Cloud` (Tobiko Cloud users only)

## Troubleshooting

### DuckDB concurrent access

If your Vulcan project uses DuckDB to store its state, you will likely encounter problems.

Vulcan can create multiple connections to the state database, but DuckDB's local database file does not support concurrent access.

Because the VSCode extension establishes a long-running process connected to the database, access conflicts are more likely than with standard Vulcan usage from the CLI. 

Therefore, we do not recommend using DuckDB as a state store with the VSCode extension.

### Environment variables

The VSCode extension is based on a [language server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol) that runs in the background as a separate process. When the VSCode extension starts the background language server, the server inherits environment variables from the environment where you started VSCode. The server does *not* inherit environment variables from your terminal instance in VSCode, so it may not have access to variables you use when calling Vulcan from the CLI.

If you have environment variables that are needed by the context and the language server, you can use one of these approaches to pass variables to the language server:

- Open VSCode from a terminal that has the variables set already. 
  - If you have `export ENV_VAR=value` in your shell configuration file (e.g. `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`) when initializing the terminal by default, the variables will be picked up by the language server if opened from that terminal.
- Use environment variables pulled from somewhere else dynamically in your `config.py` for example by connecting to a secret store
- By default, a `.env` file in your root project directory will automatically be picked up by the language server through the python environment that the extension uses. For exact details on how to set the environment variables in the Python environment that the extension uses, see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_environment-variables)

You can verify that the environment variables are being passed to the language server by printing them in your terminal. 

1. `Cmd +Shift + P` (`Ctrl + Shift + P` in case of Windows) to start the VSCode command bar
   ![print_env_vars](./vscode/print_env_vars.png)
2. Select the option: `Vulcan: Print Environment Variables`
3. You should see the environment variables printed in the terminal
   ![terminal_env_vars](./vscode/terminal_env_vars.png)

If you change your setup during development (e.g., add variables to your shell config), you must restart the language server for the changes to take effect. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

1. `Cmd +Shift + P` (`Ctrl + Shift + P` in case of Windows) to start the VSCode command bar
2. Select the option: `Vulcan: Restart Servers`
   ![restart_servers](./vscode/restart_servers.png)
   ![loaded](./vscode/loaded.png)

   > This loaded message will appear in the lower left corner of the VSCode window.

3. Print the environment variables based on the instructions above to verify the changes have taken effect.

### Python environment issues

The most common problem is the extension not using the correct Python interpreter.

Follow the [setup process described above](#vscode-python-interpreter) to ensure that the extension is using the correct Python interpreter.

If you have checked the VSCode `vulcan` output channel and the extension is still not using the correct Python interpreter, please raise an issue [here](https://github.com/tobikodata/vulcan/issues).

### Missing Python dependencies

When installing Vulcan, some dependencies required by the VSCode extension are not installed unless you specify the `lsp` "extra".

Install the `lsp` extra by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install 'vulcan[lsp]'
```

### Vulcan compatibility

While the Vulcan VSCode extension is in preview and the APIs to the underlying Vulcan version are not stable, we do not guarantee compatibility between the extension and the Vulcan version you are using.

If you encounter a problem, please raise an issue [here](https://github.com/tobikodata/vulcan/issues).
