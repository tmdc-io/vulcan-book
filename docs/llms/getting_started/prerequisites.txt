# Prerequisites

This page describes the system prerequisites needed to run Vulcan and provides instructions for meeting them.

## Docker Prerequisites

The recommended way to run Vulcan is using Docker. This provides a consistent, production-like environment.

### Docker Desktop

You'll need Docker Desktop installed and running on your machine:

- **macOS**: Download from [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **Windows**: Download from [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **Linux**: Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose following the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Verify Docker Installation

Verify that Docker is installed and running:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

You should see version numbers for both commands. If Docker Desktop is running, you should also be able to run:

```bash
docker ps
```

### System Requirements

- **RAM**: At least 4GB of available RAM (8GB recommended)
- **Disk Space**: At least 5GB of free disk space
- **CPU**: Modern multi-core processor

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop. If you're on Linux and need to install it separately, follow the [Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Python Prerequisites

!!! info "Python Library Installation"
    Vulcan will be available as a Python library in the future. When available, you'll need Python 3.8 or higher.

    For now, use the Docker installation method above.
