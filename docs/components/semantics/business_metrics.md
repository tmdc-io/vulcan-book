# Business Metrics

Business metrics are time-series analytical definitions that combine a measure, a time dimension, and optional grouping dimensions into a single queryable unit. They sit on top of [semantic models](models.md) and are the primary interface for dashboards, reports, and APIs.

---

## Where these files live

Put each metric in its own file under `models/metrics/`, one metric per file:

```
models/metrics/
├── arr_growth.yml
├── churn_analysis.yml
├── cohort_retention.yml
└── product_engagement.yml
```

**File naming:** The filename doesn't matter — Vulcan reads every YAML file in `models/metrics/`. Naming files after the metric they define keeps diffs and ownership clean.

---

## Structure

A metric is a single document with `kind: metric` at the top. Reference measures, time columns, dimensions, and segments using `<semantic_name>.<field>` notation, where `<semantic_name>` is the value of the `name:` field at the top of the corresponding semantic model.

```yaml
kind: metric
name: <metric_name>                         # Unique metric name
measure: <semantic_name>.<measure_name>     # Which measure to calculate
ts: <semantic_name>.<column_name>           # Time column for time-series analysis
granularity: <granularity>                  # Default time bucket

dimensions:                                 # Optional list of grouping dimensions
  - <semantic_name>.<column_name>           # Bare reference: name auto-derived from <column_name>
  - name: <slice_name>                      # Named slice: explicit name + ref (+ optional metadata)
    ref: <semantic_name>.<column_name>

segments:                                   # Optional list of predefined filters (strings only)
  - <semantic_name>.<segment_name>          # Auto-derived name: <semantic_name>_<segment_name>

description: "..."                          # Optional
owner: "..."                                # Optional
tags: [...]                                 # Optional
terms: [...]                                # Optional
ai_context: {...}                           # Optional — see models.md#ai-context
```

## Required properties

Every metric must define these four fields:

### name

Unique identifier consumers use to reference the metric. Must be unique within the project.

```yaml
name: arr_growth
```

### measure

A reference to a measure defined in a semantic model, in the format `<semantic_name>.<measure_name>`.

```yaml
measure: subscriptions.total_arr
```

`subscriptions` here is the `name:` at the top of the `subscriptions` semantic model file; `total_arr` is one of its measures.

### ts

A reference to a time/date column on a semantic model, in the format `<semantic_name>.<column_name>`. This is the time column used for time-series aggregation.

```yaml
ts: subscriptions.start_date
```

!!! info "measure and ts cannot be the same"
    Vulcan rejects metrics where `measure` and `ts` point to the same reference.

### granularity

The default time bucket for aggregation. Must be one of:

| Value | Bucket |
|-------|--------|
| `second` | Per-second |
| `minute` | Per-minute |
| `hour` | Hourly |
| `day` | Daily |
| `week` | Weekly |
| `month` | Monthly |
| `quarter` | Quarterly |
| `year` | Yearly |

```yaml
granularity: month
```

The default granularity is what's used when a consumer queries the metric without specifying one. Consumers can always override it at query time.

---

## Optional properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `dimensions` | List | Grouping dimensions (bare reference, or named slice with `name` + `ref`). See [Dimensions](#dimensions). |
| `segments` | List of `<semantic_name>.<segment_name>` | Predefined filters from semantic models. **Qualified-ref strings only** — no named form. |
| `description` | String | Human-readable explanation of the metric. |
| `owner` | String | Team or person responsible for the metric. |
| `tags` | List of strings | Categorization labels for discovery. See [Naming rules](models.md#naming-rules) for the allowed pattern. |
| `terms` | List of strings | Business glossary references (e.g. `glossary.revenue`). See [Naming rules](models.md#naming-rules). |
| `ai_context` | Object | Hints for AI/LLM consumers (`instructions`, `synonyms`, `examples`). See [AI context](models.md#ai-context). |

---

## Dimensions

`dimensions:` is a list. Each item can be either a bare reference to a column, or a named slice that gives the column a different display name.

### Bare reference

The most common form — just point at a column on a semantic model:

```yaml
dimensions:
  - subscriptions.plan_type
  - users.signup_channel
```

The dimension's `name` is **auto-derived** from the field part after the `.` (so `subscriptions.plan_type` becomes `plan_type`, `users.signup_channel` becomes `signup_channel`). The derived name is what consumers use in queries.

!!! warning "Shorthand name collisions fail validation"
    If two shorthand entries derive the **same** name from **different** refs, validation fails. Example:

    ```yaml
    dimensions:
      - users.country         # derives "country"
      - shipping.country      # also derives "country" — ERROR
    ```

    Switch one (or both) to the [object form](#named-slice) and give them distinct `name`s:

    ```yaml
    dimensions:
      - name: user_country
        ref: users.country
      - name: shipping_country
        ref: shipping.country
    ```

### Named slice

Use the named form when you want to expose a dimension under a different label than the underlying column, disambiguate two columns that would derive the same shorthand name, or override the semantic-field's documentation/tags/terms/AI hints for this metric:

```yaml
dimensions:
  - name: industry
    ref: users.industry
    description: Customer's reported industry
    tags:
      - customer
      - segmentation
    terms:
      - customer.industry
    ai_context:
      instructions: Filter for the top-10 industries
      synonyms:
        - sector
      examples:
        - "SaaS"
        - "FinTech"
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | The label consumers use in queries. Lowercase identifier — see [Naming rules](models.md#naming-rules). Must be unique across this metric's `dimensions` **and** `segments`. |
| `ref` | Yes | The actual semantic reference (`<semantic_name>.<column>`). Both halves must be valid identifiers. |
| `description` | No | Human-readable explanation. **Overrides** the description on the underlying semantic field for this metric. |
| `tags` | No | List of categorization labels. **Overrides** the underlying field's tags for this metric. |
| `terms` | No | List of business glossary references. **Overrides** the underlying field's terms for this metric. |
| `ai_context` | No | Hints for AI/LLM consumers (`instructions`, `synonyms`, `examples`). **Overrides** the underlying field's `ai_context` for this metric. |

!!! info "Override scope"
    Overrides apply only to this metric's view of the dimension. Other metrics referencing the same column still see whatever is defined on the semantic model.

You can freely mix bare references and named slices in the same `dimensions:` list:

```yaml
dimensions:
  - subscriptions.plan_type
  - users.signup_channel
  - name: industry
    ref: users.industry
```

Dimensions can reference columns from any semantic model, as long as the models are connected through joins.

---

## Segments

Segments apply predefined filters from semantic models to a metric. Reference them using `<semantic_name>.<segment_name>`:

```yaml
segments:
  - subscriptions.active_subscriptions
  - subscriptions.high_value_accounts
```

The segments `active_subscriptions` and `high_value_accounts` must be defined in the `subscriptions` semantic model. When the metric is queried, these filters are applied automatically.

### Segment rules

| Aspect | Rule |
|--------|------|
| Entry type | **Must** be a qualified-reference string. Dict / object form is rejected by the parser. |
| `ref` shape | `<semantic_name>.<segment_name>` — both halves must be valid identifiers. |
| Auto-derived `name` | `<semantic_name>_<segment_name>`, lowercased. Must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,63}$` and must not collide with any dimension `name` on this metric. |
| Per-entry metadata | **Not supported.** Unlike dimensions, segments on a metric cannot carry per-entry `description`, `tags`, `terms`, or `ai_context`. To override segment metadata, edit it on the underlying semantic model. |

Example of how derived names work:

```yaml
segments:
  - usage_sessions.mobile_sessions   # derived name: usage_sessions_mobile_sessions
  - usage_sessions.long_sessions     # derived name: usage_sessions_long_sessions
```

---

## Cross-model metrics

A metric can pull its measure, ts, and dimensions from different semantic models. Vulcan resolves the join paths automatically based on the joins defined in your semantic models.

```yaml
kind: metric
name: cohort_retention
measure: users.active_users
ts: users.signup_date
granularity: month

dimensions:
  - users.signup_channel
  - subscriptions.plan_type

description: User retention by signup cohort and plan type
```

This metric uses the `active_users` measure and `signup_date` time from the `users` model, but groups by `plan_type` from the `subscriptions` model. The `users` semantic model must have a join defined to `subscriptions` for this to work.

!!! warning "Joins are required for cross-model references"
    If a metric references multiple semantic models, those models must be connected through joins. Vulcan validates this and will raise an error if a join path doesn't exist.

---

## Time granularity

Define a metric once, query it at any granularity. The `granularity:` value sets the default, but consumers can override it at query time:

- `granularity=day`
- `granularity=week`
- `granularity=month`
- `granularity=quarter`
- `granularity=year`

You don't need separate metric definitions for daily, weekly, and monthly views of the same data.

---

## Examples

### Minimal

The smallest valid metric is just the four required fields:

```yaml
# models/metrics/churn_analysis.yml
kind: metric
name: churn_analysis
measure: subscriptions.churn_count
ts: subscriptions.end_date
granularity: month
```

### With dimensions and description

```yaml
# models/metrics/churn_analysis.yml
kind: metric
name: churn_analysis
measure: subscriptions.churn_count
ts: subscriptions.end_date
granularity: month

dimensions:
  - subscriptions.plan_type
  - users.signup_channel

description: Churn patterns by plan and acquisition channel
```

### Cross-model with named slice

```yaml
# models/metrics/cohort_retention.yml
kind: metric
name: cohort_retention
measure: users.active_users
ts: users.signup_date
granularity: month

dimensions:
  - users.signup_channel
  - subscriptions.plan_type

description: User retention by signup cohort and plan type
```

### Full example with segments, tags, terms

```yaml
# models/metrics/arr_growth.yml
kind: metric
name: arr_growth
measure: subscriptions.total_arr
ts: subscriptions.start_date
granularity: month

dimensions:
  - subscriptions.plan_type
  - name: industry
    ref: users.industry

segments:
  - subscriptions.active_subscriptions
  - subscriptions.high_value_accounts

description: Annual Recurring Revenue growth by plan and industry
tags:
  - revenue
  - arr
  - metric
terms:
  - glossary.annual_recurring_revenue
  - glossary.revenue_metric
```

---

## Forbidden legacy keys

Two keys from earlier versions of the metric spec are **explicitly rejected** and will cause validation to fail:

| Legacy key | Use instead | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| `time` | `ts` | The time-column field was renamed. |
| `slices` | `dimensions` | The grouping field was renamed and switched from a dict to a list. |

If you're migrating an older project, do a global replace before running `vulcan plan`.

---

## Reserved names

The following names cannot be used as a dimension `name` (object form) or as the auto-derived `name` of a segment on a metric:

- `measure`
- `time`
- `ts`

They're reserved as adjunct keys on the metric envelope. Pick a different name (e.g. `plan_type` instead of `time`). For segments, this means you can't reference a segment whose `<semantic_name>_<segment_name>` derivation collides with one of the reserved names.

---

## Validation

Vulcan validates metric definitions automatically when you create a plan. It checks that:

- `measure` references a valid measure on a semantic model
- `ts` references a valid time/date column
- `granularity` is a recognized granularity value (see [granularity table](#granularity))
- Every qualified reference (`measure`, `ts`, and each dimension/segment `ref`) is a valid `<semantic_name>.<field>` where both halves are valid identifiers
- **All qualified refs used by the metric are unique** — you cannot use the same `<semantic_name>.<field>` as both `measure` and `ts`, or as two dimensions, etc.
- **All names are unique across `dimensions` and `segments`** (dimension `name`s plus auto-derived segment `name`s, considered as one combined set)
- Dimension references point to real columns
- Named slices include both `name` and `ref`
- Segment entries are qualified-reference strings (not objects) and their auto-derived `<semantic_name>_<segment_name>` matches the lowercase identifier pattern
- Cross-model references have valid join paths between the involved models
- Forbidden legacy keys (`time`, `slices`) are not present
- Reserved names (`measure`, `time`, `ts`) are not used as a dimension or auto-derived segment `name`
- All identifier names match the [naming rules](models.md#naming-rules)
- No unknown keys appear inside `ai_context` (Pydantic `extra="forbid"`)
