# Quickstart

Welcome to the Vulcan quickstart, which will get you up and running with an example project.

The example project runs locally on your machine with a DuckDB SQL engine, and Vulcan will generate all the necessary project files - no configuration necessary!

All you need to do is install Vulcan on your machine - get started by ensuring your system meets the basic [prerequisites for using Vulcan](./prerequisites.md).

Head over to the [CLI Quickstart](./quickstart/cli.md)
