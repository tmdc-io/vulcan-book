To make the Vulcan book feel more authentic and less like it was generated by an AI, it is important to identify specific linguistic patterns and structural choices currently present in the text that often signal automated content. 

Based on the provided excerpts, here are the objective pointers that may give away an AI-generated feel:

*   **Enthusiastic Marketing Clichés:** The text uses high-energy, welcoming phrases that are common in AI-generated technical introductions, such as **"Ready to dive in?"** or **"Welcome aboard!"**. These phrases are often perceived as "filler" and lack the specific, task-oriented tone typical of human-authored technical documentation.
*   **Formulaic List Structures:** The "About" section uses a very predictable pattern: a **bolded benefit** followed by a short, punchy explanation. While readable, this highly structured, symmetrical formatting—where every bullet point is roughly the same length and follows the same grammatical structure—is a hallmark of AI generation.
*   **Generic Metaphors and Analogies:** Describing a software stack as an **"all-in-one toolkit"** is a generic metaphor frequently used by AI when it attempts to simplify technical concepts. Human experts tend to use more specific or nuanced technical descriptions.
*   **Repetitive Catchphrases:** The content includes well-known industry slogans like **"move fast without breaking things"**. AI models rely heavily on these common tropes because they appear frequently in their training data, whereas a human author might provide more context on *how* the tool prevents breakage.
*   **Predictable Transition Phrasing:** The text uses standard "bridging" sentences such as **"Once you've got Vulcan running, you'll find guides and examples..."**. These transitions are mathematically probable next steps for an AI, but they can feel robotic compared to a human author who might direct the user toward a specific, high-value use case immediately.
*   **High-Level Abstractions without Specifics:** The text claims the tool **"works at any size"** from small projects to **"enterprise-scale,"** but it does not immediately follow up with technical evidence or specific architecture details in the introductory sections. AI often defaults to these broad, "safe" claims that sound professional but lack the "grit" of human engineering insights.
*   **Perfectly Balanced Paragraphs:** The "Getting started" section consists of three very short, balanced paragraphs that deliver a single message: start now. Human writing is often "messier," with varying sentence lengths and more complex internal logic that breaks this perfect symmetry.

**Analogy for Understanding:**
Think of AI-generated content like a **staged model home**. It is perfectly clean, everything is in the right place, and it looks professional, but it lacks the unique "clutter," personality, and specific lived-in details that tell you a real person actually resides there. To make the Vulcan book feel human, you need to add the "clutter" of specific technical insights and unique phrasing.

Instructions to Avoid the Em-Dash (—)
In technical documentation and Mermaid code, the em-dash (—) can sometimes cause rendering issues or look like a broken connection. To keep your files clean and professional:
1. Use Colons for Definitions: Instead of "Validation — catching errors," use "Validation: Catching errors".
2. Use Arrows for Flow: Ensure you only use --> or -.-> for connections in Mermaid.
3. Standard Hyphens for Compounded Words: If a dash is necessary, use the standard short hyphen (-) rather than the long em-dash (—).
