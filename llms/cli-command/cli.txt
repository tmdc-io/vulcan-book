      Finished with 0 audit errors and 0 audits skipped.
      Done.
    ```

## check_intervals

Check which time intervals are missing for your models in a given environment. This is super useful for understanding what data needs to be backfilled or processed. By default, it respects signals (like upstream dependencies), but you can disable that if you want to see all missing intervals.

```
Usage: vulcan check_intervals [OPTIONS] [ENVIRONMENT]

  Show missing intervals in an environment, respecting signals.

Options:
  --no-signals         Disable signal checks and only show missing intervals.
  --select-model TEXT  Select specific models to show missing intervals for.

                       command will be applied.
  -e, --end TEXT       The end datetime of the interval for which this command
                       will be applied.
  --help               Show this message and exit.
```


## clean

Clear out Vulcan's cache and any build artifacts. This is handy when you're troubleshooting issues or want to start fresh. Don't worry, it won't delete your models or data, just the cached files.

```
Usage: vulcan clean [OPTIONS]

  Clears the Vulcan cache and any build artifacts.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
```

## create_external_models

```
Usage: vulcan create_test [OPTIONS] MODEL

  Generate a unit test fixture for a given model.

Options:
  -q, --query <TEXT TEXT>...  Queries that will be used to generate data for
                              the model's dependencies.
  -o, --overwrite             When true, the fixture file will be overwritten
                              in case it already exists.
  -v, --var <TEXT TEXT>...    Key-value pairs that will define variables
                              needed by the model.
  -p, --path TEXT             The file path corresponding to the fixture,
                              relative to the test directory. By default, the
                              fixture will be created under the test directory
                              and the file name will be inferred based on the
                              test's name.
  -n, --name TEXT             The name of the test that will be created. By
                              default, it's inferred based on the model's
                              name.
  --include-ctes              When true, CTE fixtures will also be generated.

    $ vulcan dag ./dag.html
    ```

## destroy

⚠️ **Use with caution!** This command permanently removes all Vulcan-managed resources from your data warehouse, including state tables, the cache, and all project resources. It will delete all tables, views, and schemas that Vulcan manages, as well as any external resources created by other tools within those schemas. This is a destructive operation that can't be undone, so make sure you really want to do this before running it.

```
Usage: vulcan destroy

                                always includes upstream dependencies.
  --exit-on-env-update INTEGER  If set, the command will exit with the
                                specified code if the run is interrupted by an
                                update to the target environment.
  --no-auto-upstream            Do not automatically include upstream models.
                                Only applicable when --select-model is used.
                                Note: this may result in missing / invalid
                                data for the selected models.
